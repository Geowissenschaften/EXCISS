# MCU firmware

It is the flight ready source code, but it requires some cleanup.

The firmware is tailored to meet the requirements for the EXCISS mission.

Some library's are fork of existing library's. Mainly the i2c and onewire library's are heavily modified to prevent any blocking caused by faulty components.

The battery management library is a bare minimum implementation.
